The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19. Results: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P < .001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. In-hospital mortality was higher during COVID-19 (7.5% vs 5.1%; unadjusted OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.07-2.11; P < .001); this association remained after adjustment for confounders (risk-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.12-3.14; P = .017). In the 2020 cohort, there was a 6.3% incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. Conclusions: The number of STEMI patients treated during the current COVID-19 outbreak fell vs the previous year and there was an increase in the median time from symptom onset to reperfusion and a significant 2-fold increase in the rate of in-hospital mortality. No changes in reperfusion strategy were detected, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention performed for the vast majority of patients. The co-existence of STEMI and SARS-CoV-2 infection was relatively infrequent.",

On January 9, 2020, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the causative agent of this outbreak, and its associated disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 . The infection spread rapidly, and the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11. 1 By May 1, 2020, more than 1.6 million cases had been diagnosed in 179 countries on 5 continents, with nearly 100 000 confirmed deaths. 1 The Spanish Government activated a State of Emergency on March 14, which restricted the movement of all citizens, except those going to work, to hospitals or health centers, and to financial institutions and those shopping for groceries, pharmaceutics, and basic necessities. 2 The impact of this new disease on societal behavior and on health care system performance is unprecedented in recent history. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, some preliminary reports have highlighted a decrease in the number of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients attending hospitals in Europe and North America, [3] [4] [5] but we have limited information on how the outbreak has affected STEMI networks in terms of delays to reperfusion, revascularization strategies, and clinical outcomes. 6, 7 The objective of this study was to compare clinical characteristics, management, and hospital outcomes in a nationwide cohort between STEMI patients who attended in the first 30 days after the Spanish lockdown during the current COVID-19 outbreak and those who attended in a period prior to COVID-19.",

El objetivo de este estudio es evaluar los cambios en el tratamiento del IAMCEST durante el brote de COVID-19. Me\u00b4todos: Se utiliz\u00f3 un registro multic\u00e9 ntrico, nacional, retrospectivo y observacional de pacientes consecutivos atendidos en 75 centros, se compararon las caracter\u00edsticas de los pacientes y de los procedimientos y los resultados hospitalarios en 2 cohortes seg\u00fa n se los hubiera tratado antes o durante la COVID-19. Resultados: Los casos con sospecha de IAMCEST disminuyeron el 27,6% y los pacientes con IAMCEST confirmado se redujeron de 1.305 a 1.009 (22,7%) .

Furthermore, patients had longer delays to reperfusion, largely due to later consultation of the health system because we found no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. Ischemic time duration is a major determinant of infarct size in patients with STEMI, and prompt recognition and early management of acute STEMI is critical in reducing morbidity and mortality. [10] [11] [12] Interestingly, the COVID-19 cohort showed a higher prevalence of previous coronary artery disease and more multivessel disease, suggesting that patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may have been less reluctant to go to the hospital. Despite the logistical difficulties caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, we did not detect an increase in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion, which indicates a good adaptation of STEMI networks to the current crisis. On the contrary, there was a longer time from catheterization laboratory arrival to reperfusion, probably due to time spent on the protective measures required for the procedures. 13 Potential behavioral explanations for these results would be a combination of avoidance of medical care due to social distancing and concerns about contracting COVID-19 in hospitals. The ongoing outbreak has received massive news coverage, with particular emphasis on the most common forms of infection and places where SARS-CoV-2 spreads more easily. Fear is a well-known determinant of medical care avoidance 14 and hospital avoidance behaviors have been linked to pandemics. 15 ",

This could be a) because we analyzed only patients with confirmed STEMI diagnosis and thus excluded other causes of myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries, such as myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome, non-STEMI, and pulmonary embolism, which represented about 10% of patients in our series; or b) because previously published data probably concerned nonconsecutive and highly selected patients.",

Baseline and follow-up data were assessed at the center-level by each clinician-investigator, without central confirmation, potentially resulting in inaccuracies and misclassifications. Nevertheless, data on interventional cardiology are quite standardized worldwide and the electronic case report form was designed to be intuitively and universally completed by all clinicians. Moreover, we applied a mixed regression model including hospital as a random variable, which considered within-and between-hospital variations over time. In any case, the potential variability among clinicians approximates our findings to those of clinical practice and improves their generalizability. Any potential selection bias was addressed by adjustment of logistic regressions for potential confounders with prognostic implications, although some residual confounding (either measured or unmeasured) might remain after multivariate modeling.",
